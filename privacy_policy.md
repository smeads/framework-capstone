### Ads Context and Attribution: ###

TabIt does not and will not use ads.

### Extensions Quality Guidelines ###

This extension has a single purpose that is narrow and easy-to-understand.  TabIt will not be an extension that requires users to accept bundles of unrelated functionality, such as an email notifier and a news headline aggregator, or downloads a local executable. If two pieces of functionality are clearly separate, they should be put into two different extensions, and users should have the ability to install and uninstall them separately.

### Questions or Concerns ###

Feel free to create an issue right here in TabIt's GitHub repository with your question/concern.
